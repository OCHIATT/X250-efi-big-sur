## Installation üîß‚öôÔ∏è
At the suggestion of user "Crash Override" from [/r/Hackintosh Paradise](https://discord.gg/u8V7N5C "/r/Hackintosh Paradise")
Broadwell machines struggle to dmg boot, so I created the bootable usb with [gibMacOS](https://github.com/corpnewt/gibMacOS "/r/Hackintosh Paradise").
I followed [Dortania's guide](https://dortania.github.io/OpenCore-Install-Guide/ "Dortania's Guide") and I was able to make the machine work seamlessly.
Follow the [Post Intall Guide](https://dortania.github.io/OpenCore-Post-Install/) "Post Install Guide") as well.
